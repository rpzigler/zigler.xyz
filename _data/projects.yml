    Developed and produced a weekly financial talk radio show hosted by Zigler & Associates called, "On the Money," which was on the Twin Cities radio station, WLTE.  I was responsible for creating the content of the show, writing the script, submitting the script to our Advertising Compliance department, negotiating a middle ground between what the hosts wanted to talk about on-air and what Advertising Compliance was comfortable with what the hosts talked about on air, and screening calls and questions from the audience during the show.
