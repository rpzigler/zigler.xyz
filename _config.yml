  When I'm not working, you'll likely find me tinkering and deploying random hardware for various projects around my house. So perhaps the section title was a little bit of a white lie as these project normally involve some sort of coding, but it's mainly playing with hardware.

  When I'm not at my desk, I try to be outdoors and as active as possible! I love hockey and I try to play as much golf as life and Minnesota weather will allow. My other hobbies include travelling, hiking, camping, photography, and cooking/BBQing.
